# One-piece-Matching-Game
Hey there. Welcome to my first Matching Game.
So far, I've only been able to get numbers to appear when playing the game. I'm still not too great at using github when it comes to 
uploading so please use the most recent documents I have available.
 Also, I worked on the project on codepen since I was having alot of issues getting everything to work properly.
 I'd like feedback if applicable and thank you!
